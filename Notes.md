Ok, so there are some unnecesary code in there just for design purposes.
And I used Turbo C++ as My IDE, because thats what my prof use.
I haven't tried to use this code in other IDE.
Also there is a mistake in line 262, it automatically makes you place bet without the user input.
I'm still learning in C and if you find something wrong, pls contact me. I want to know for me to learn
